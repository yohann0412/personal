    "content": "I made 2 cold calls today before office. definitely not enough but its a good start. started the first one off bumbling like an idiot, tried to ask the receptionist who i was speaking to and she just said the name of the clinic LMAO she mustve thought i wasn't paying attention. She just said she would 'contact me back later' in an annoyed tone. Second call was a lot better, started off by asking how she was, and then eventually got a contact email. technically just the clinics main email, but i asked her really nicely if she would let PLEASE let dr. 'x' know that i emailed - i know cold emails usually hit the wall so i was hoping that made a difference. lol i go home to email her and turns out ive already cold emailed them a week back with no response LMAO. \nI'd like to think I'm decent at talking to people and this typa thing but definitely need to refine a flow to this. There's definitely a structure, I think I'll learn just by doing and not reading though. \nAnother thing I'm internalizing - I realized cold emails were a bad way to get people to teach me about their workflows since it felt too impersonal and thought cold calls were the 'magical ticket' (not really but felt like a breakthrough at the time). I'm having the equivalent moment today, but the 'cold call' is just visiting them in person. I've scheduled 3 clinics to go to in the next few days. I'm gonna try to see if I can have better luck irl. \nAs always, no idea what I'm doing really, just a vision to help small practice owners save time and focus on actually treating people"
