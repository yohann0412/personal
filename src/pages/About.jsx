          I'm trying to figure out how to build things that matter.

        <p>
          I study math and computer science at UCSD and spend a decent chunk of my time making stuff, currently 9-5 at 
          at TikTok and sometimes on my own. Right now, I'm chasing a hunch that small, boring 
          problems (like scheduling, paperwork, and admin in small clinics) are worth solving 
          with the right tools. I've been trying to find a problem worth solving and I think this is something worth considering. at least in the short run.

          This site isn't a portfolio. It's where I dump what I'm learning: cold calls that 
          flop, features that ship, and thoughts that stick (or don't).
